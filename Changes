0.03    2006-06-21
        Changed default type to Btree in preparation for the addition of
	DB->compact to the BerkeleyDB perl wrapper. Chances are good I'll
	add this functionality with some kind of options as soon as its
	available to keep cache file sizes to a minimum.
	
	Added mkpath() so that a cache_root will be created several
	directories deep if it doesn't yet exist.

	Fixed a bug related to opening an existing physical db file with a
	new logical db.

	Some other minor cleanup here and there.
